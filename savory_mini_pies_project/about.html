        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Savory Mini Pies was founded in 1974 by the Sawyer family. The Sawyers were known for their delicious savory pies and decided to open a
          bakery to share their pies with the world. The bakery has been passed down through the generations and is now run by the Sawyer siblings,
          Jedidiah and Regan. The bakery is known for its delicious pies, friendly staff, and welcoming atmosphere.
